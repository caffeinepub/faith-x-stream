  "summary": "The diff implements authentication state synchronization fixes, actor readiness checks, comprehensive logging, and LiveTVSyncPlayer refactoring. Most requirements are addressed with evidence of state management improvements, useEffect-based navigation, and console logging throughout the auth flow. However, UI reversion requirements (REQ-76, REQ-77) lack concrete evidence in the truncated diffs.",

      "requirement": "Revert unintended visual changes to Header navigation component to restore expected appearance before recent updates, ensuring navigation links, spacing, styling, and layout match the original design without breaking responsive behavior or accessibility",
      "reason": "The Header.tsx diff shows authentication logic changes and console logging, but does not show evidence of reverting visual changes to navigation links, spacing, styling, or layout structure. No class name changes, spacing adjustments, or layout modifications are visible in the truncated diff.",

      "reason": "No evidence of UI styling or layout reversions in the modified pages (HomePage, LivePage, LoginPage, VideoPlayerPage, EpisodePlayerPage). The diffs show functional changes but no class name modifications, layout structure changes, or styling adjustments that would indicate visual appearance restoration.",
