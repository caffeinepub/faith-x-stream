  "summary": "Video streaming/content platform app with admin dashboard; address autoplay, video management, and UI stability; evolve UX toward Pluto TV-style FAST/live channels with guide browsing; add Live TV-specific playback controls (disable seeking forward) and scheduled unskippable ads; separate Live TV eligibility and standalone VOD availability via two independent toggles on content upload/edit (Movies, Podcasts, TV Shows); auto-generate clips/short-form content from uploaded videos with same name but different captions; keep Movies and Podcasts as separate admin sections.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Admin dashboard should be organized by content type with dedicated upload flows (Movies, TV Shows, Podcasts, Clips, Live TV).",
    "Video entities require a content-type field (e.g., movie/film/podcast/etc.) to drive admin UI and update/edit logic.",
    "Explore Pluto TV-like FAST model: channel entities + scheduled programming (EPG) and guide-based navigation layered on top of existing VOD content.",
    "Live TV VOD scheduling relies on program duration derived from VOD asset length; playback must not reset to 0 on program transitions or scheduler ticks.",
    "Live TV playback should disable forward seeking/scrubbing while preserving linear schedule-based playback behavior.",
    "Ad system should support server/client-defined scheduled insertion points and enforce unskippable playback during ads for guest and authenticated users.",
    "Content availability is controlled by two independent toggles: 'Eligible for Live TV scheduling' and 'Available as standalone VOD'; content can be Live-only, VOD-only, or both.",
    "System should auto-generate clips/short-form content entries when videos are uploaded (Movies/Podcasts/TV Shows), using the same name but different captions, and maintain linkage to source content.",
    "Videos section in admin panel should serve as a catch-all content category for items that don't fit Movies/TV Shows/Podcasts/Clips, and should support auto-clip generation like other content types.",
    "Home page should include a TikTok/YouTube Shorts-style vertical scrolling feed for clips/short-form content that displays both auto-generated and manually uploaded clips in an engaging, swipeable format."

  "known_issues": [
    "Autoplay is freezing and not playing.",
    "UI is bugged in Live, Originals, Profile/MyProfile, and Admin Panel Dashboard.",
    "Updating videos fails with 'Failed to update'.",
    "Live TV (VOD-scheduled) channels restart the VOD from the beginning after a few seconds on all channels instead of continuing linearly according to the schedule.",
    "Login (both Internet Identity and email/password) is broken with a loading loop after requesting Live TV synchronization features - click login, shows loading, then reverts to login button without completing authentication.",
    "Navigation bar and UI elements have unintended visual changes that need to be reverted to restore expected appearance."
