  "architectural_notes": [
    "Admin dashboard should be organized by content type with dedicated upload flows (Movies, TV Shows, Podcasts, Clips, Live TV).",
    "Video entities require a content-type field (e.g., movie/film/podcast/etc.) to drive admin UI and update/edit logic.",
    "Explore Pluto TV-like FAST model: channel entities + scheduled programming (EPG) and guide-based navigation layered on top of existing VOD content.",
    "Live TV VOD scheduling relies on program duration derived from VOD asset length; playback must not reset to 0 on program transitions or scheduler ticks.",
    "Live TV playback should disable forward seeking/scrubbing while preserving linear schedule-based playback behavior.",
    "Ad system should support server/client-defined scheduled insertion points and enforce unskippable playback during ads for guest and authenticated users.",
    "Content availability is controlled by two independent toggles: 'Eligible for Live TV scheduling' and 'Available as standalone VOD'; content can be Live-only, VOD-only, or both.",
    "System should auto-generate clips/short-form content entries when videos are uploaded (Movies/Podcasts/TV Shows), using the same name but different captions, and maintain linkage to source content.",
    "Videos section in admin panel should serve as a catch-all content category for items that don't fit Movies/TV Shows/Podcasts/Clips, and should support auto-clip generation like other content types.",
    "Home page should include a TikTok/YouTube Shorts-style vertical scrolling feed for clips/short-form content that displays both auto-generated and manually uploaded clips in an engaging, swipeable format."
