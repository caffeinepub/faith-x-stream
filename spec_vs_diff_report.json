  "summary": "The diff implements most of the five requirements (REQ-94 through REQ-98) with substantial coverage. Key additions include HeroSection, ContentRow, BrandRail components, redesigned Header, updated MoviesPage/TVShowsPage/PodcastsPage with genre filters, updated NetworksPage, updated index.css and tailwind.config.js color tokens, and a new PodcastsPage. However, a few specific acceptance criteria have gaps, most notably the TVShowsPage genre filter not actually filtering content, and the tailwind.config.js still using hsl() wrappers for most color tokens despite the requirement to update to OKLCH-based values.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-97",
      "requirement": "Selecting a genre filter on TVShowsPage updates the content grid to show only matching items without a full page reload",
      "reason": "In TVShowsPage.tsx, the filtered useMemo explicitly returns allSeries regardless of selectedGenre (comment says 'for now show all when All selected'), meaning genre filter chips do not actually filter the TV Shows grid.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-98",
      "requirement": "Primary red/accent color values in tailwind.config.js are updated to be more saturated/vibrant using OKLCH",
      "reason": "tailwind.config.js still maps most semantic tokens (background, foreground, primary, secondary, etc.) through hsl(var(--...)) rather than oklch(), meaning the OKLCH values defined in index.css are not directly wired. The brand.* tokens use var() correctly, but primary/accent/card tokens still wrap in hsl().",
